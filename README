HTML Notes:   Make sure every HTML form field that you want to protect has a name

Usage:        The demo is amazingly unfancy. Just download form_protector.js, insert it, and watch the magic happen. You will need to decide how you want to clear the local storage. in my HTML, I just put a button with inline JavaScript for that.
