Version History:	
v1.0	::	Forminator published. basic functionality for local storage protection on all form inputs
v2.0	::  Forminator turned into a jQuery plugin:
			Accepts three arguments: fields to protect, attribute to use as a key, clear button
			Only stores data for the form for which you apply the method
			changed storage key to be  [form id]-[name attr]
			added some notes at the top of the plugin
Usage:        The demo is amazingly unfancy. Just download form_protector.js, insert it, and watch the magic happen. You will need to decide how you want to clear the local storage. in my HTML, I just put a button with inline JavaScript for that.
